# The Role of Sustainable Finance Education for Investment Behavior in Developing Countries – Evidence from Egypt
We study the impact of an information set on socially responsible investing (SRI) on investment attitude in a developing country context. We conduct an information provision experiment at a university in Cairo, providing treated participants with information on the severity of currently relevant social issues and the potential of sustainable investments to tackle them. We find that the effectiveness of information provision depends on the underlying social issue. Specifically, the information intervention was effective in positively influencing participants’ investment propensity towards gender equality and their willingness to pay (WTP) for investments in poverty reduction. We also observe that participants’ beliefs on the effectiveness of impact investments aimed at specific issues are positively correlated with their investment attitudes towards these issues. Our results reveal the importance of disentangling social issues when mobilizing individual sustainable investment behavior. Further, our study implies that SRI awareness campaigns in developing countries can be effective if targeted at the right issues, pushing for more investments in countries with the most pressing need for action.
